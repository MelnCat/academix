# Academix

## Inspiration
As students ourselves, we have first-hand experience with the horrors of Microsoft Teams and MyEducation. Unresponsive, slow and inaccessible, we thought that there must be a better solution.

## What it does

A fast, responsive, accessible and user-friendly learning platform!

Features:
* Classes
* Assignments
* Schedules
* Attendance
** Excuse absences online!
* Student record
* Chats with other students
* Graduation progress
* Volunteer hours
* Teaching material upload

Academix is responsive, high-performance, and accessible for screen readers.

## How we built it

Academix is made with Nuxt. We used Vuestic as the component library, and REST for the API. The backend is powered by Sequelize and MySQL. The entire project is hosted on Vercel!

## Challenges we ran into

We spent much work on crafting a user interface design that was truly intuitive! While it was time-consuming, we don't regret it one bit.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're really proud of Academix's performance. We strived to make it as best as possible for people on low-end devices.

## What we learned

A lot of our team wasn't familiar with Nuxt before! We now are quite fluent.

## What's next for Academix

We plan to propose our interface to the B.C. Ministry of Education and encourage them to move away from Follet as a contractor.
